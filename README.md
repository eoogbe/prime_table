# Prime Table

This web application displays a multiplication table of prime numbers.

## How to run it

This app uses Ruby v3.1.2 and runs well in the latest Chrome browser.

To install dependencies, run:

```console
$ bundle install
```

To run the development server, run:

```console
$ bin/dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

To run the tests, run:

```console
$ bin/rspec
```

## What I'm pleased with

TODO: Add once I've implemented the app

## What I would do if I had more time

- Input validation (Issue #1)
- CSS styling (Issue #2)
- Link to the next prime table from each number in the table (Issue #3)
